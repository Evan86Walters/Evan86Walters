## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I am a cloud engineer with hands-on experience in designing and building serverless architectures using AWS services such as Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB. My focus is on creating fast, scalable, and cost-effective applications that leverage the power of cloud infrastructure, allowing businesses to scale seamlessly without the overhead of managing traditional servers.

AWS Lambda has been central to my work, enabling me to build serverless applications where I can focus on writing application logic without worrying about provisioning or managing servers. With Lambda, I can design event-driven functions that automatically scale in response to triggers from services like API Gateway, S3, or DynamoDB. This serverless approach allows me to optimize both cost and performance, as resources are allocated dynamically based on demand.

API Gateway plays a key role in providing a secure and scalable entry point for my applications. I use it to expose RESTful APIs, manage routing, and implement authorization and rate limiting. By integrating API Gateway with Lambda, I can quickly deploy robust APIs that handle high traffic volumes while maintaining low operational overhead.

DynamoDB is my preferred NoSQL database for serverless applications, offering seamless scalability and low-latency data access. I leverage DynamoDBâ€™s flexible schema and auto-scaling capabilities to store and retrieve large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, without worrying about provisioning or managing database instances.

This repository showcases some of my serverless projects, including practical examples of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB in action. Whether youâ€™re exploring serverless architecture or building cloud-native applications, I hope you find these resources helpful. Feel free to explore, contribute, or reach out if you have any questions or ideas for collaboration!
